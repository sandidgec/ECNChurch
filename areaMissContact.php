                                    <h3>Bishop of Navajoland</h3>
                                        Prior to his 2010 arrival in Navajoland, Bishop Dave Bailey was the Rector of St. Stephens Parish in Phoenix, AZ.
                                        There he developed a 60 bed Retreat Center which, at times, would provide free shelter to Navajo families whom would travel to the city for advanced medical treatment.
                                        He chaired Native American Ministries in the Diocese of Arizona, held a position in Coalition 14 and thus created a bond with the Episcopal Church in Navajoland.
                                        In 1994, upon the Presiding Bishop’s Appointment, Dave assisted Navajoland Bishop Steven Plummer in an administrative capacity. He would work with Bishop Plummer for 5-6 weeks a year.
                                        In his down time, Bishop Dave’s interests include reading, golf, hiking and participating in 5k’s.
                                        Bishop Dave Bailey is honored to be serving in Navajoland, is excited about what has been accomplished and equally excited about the future.

                                Each Sunday they would pass St. Johns and she would often think of how lonely and deserted it looked, not knowing that one day she would bring life to that church by serving children and conduct Navajo only services.
                                After finishing school and working full time for many years, Lillie accepted a position granted by Bishop Stephen Plummer as Lay Pastor of St. John’s Episcopal Church.
                                Due to the uncleanliness of the water around the community of St. Johns, Lillie makes weekly trips to St. Christopher’s to haul clean water to her church, and in the future she would like to work on ways to make the water clean.

                                Rev. Deacon Leon Sampson was raised on St. Christopher’s grounds and sat in the same pews his children sit in now.
                                By continuing to live and raise his family in the same house he grew up in, he is allowing his children to have the same experiences he had and also the experiences his parents had before him.
                                He wants his children to understand and keep in their heart and their mind, the life cycle of the church, and to keep the passion that they all share of being here in Church.
                                His mission is to give back to the youth, get them involved in church so they can remember their positive experiences and come back later.
                                Leon is currently enrolled in a three-year program at Virginia Theological Seminary and plans to come back as Priest to continue to serve the people and develop more projects.

                                    Michael Sells developed a habit of attending church while in college and the Army.
                                    When he returned to Navajoland, he started going to bible studies where he met many passionate elders who would remind him of his grandmother.
                                    He attended church regularly, and was nominated to various committees, the vestry, and was encouraged to attend Vancouver School of Theology for the summer.
                                    He left Navajoland a short time for Law School and work, but realized he was at his happiest when he was serving.
                                    He currently attends The Church Divinity School of the Pacific in Berkeley, CA. His professors are amazing, challenging and concerned of his well-being.
                                    He loves re-reading his text books.  When he is not mentally exhausted, he enjoys riding his bike down to the marina and back up “holy hill.”
                                    He loves watching the college football games at the Cal stadium, and as an added bonus Cal is a member of the PAC-12 conference.  Go Sundevils!
                                    He also loves to work in the gardens around campus, or just spend time laughing with his crazy seminarian friends.
