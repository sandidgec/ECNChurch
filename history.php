Our possessions were taken, our farmlands destroyed, and our livestock killed. Later, our children were taken from us, placed in boarding schools, and punished for speaking our language and practicing our culture. We have internalized much of this sorrow, and today, we experience high rates of addiction and suicide. Given our geography, unemployment and under-employment are high.

All real Missions started out as a Medical Mission. In 1978, The Episcopal Church founded the Area Mission on the 27,000 square miles in Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah, which are contiguous with the Navajo Nation. Until recently, our buildings were falling into disrepair and leadership and vision came from non-native clergy.

                    <div class="panel-body">Today, there is a new spirit and a new energy in our land! We have re-opened some churches and planted new ones. We have ordained four Navajo priests and three deacons. We have reached out to the many Navajo military veterans. We have repaired derelict properties for rental income and program use. We are expanding retreat opportunities and building hogans for educational ceremonial purposes. As time passes, the world is looking to indigenous peoples and communities to learn and engage in our history and traditions. Some of the projects we ,in the Episcopal Church In Navajoland, developed to help mother earth and help put us on the road to self sufficiency is the Blue Corn project, Shi'Ma Soaps and the Bee Project. True to our culture, corn is important and sacred, we use corn in ceremony and is a stepal food item. Along with our nourishing corn, herbs and roots collected all around Navajoland are made into various healing soaps made in the kitchens on ground and packaged by our people. In the first months of receiving bees and hives, we were able to produce 100 pounds of honey and in the process pollinate our blue corn fields, squash, and other edible items. We have adapted in recycling, and abolishing the use of styrofoam and compost all things we can.But, as times passes, and we continue in the teachings and learning of our culture, we also need to adapt to technology. By creating the Cheii's Dev Shop, we aim to bring web development training to our Navajo people so that we have the skill set so needed in Navajoland. These efforts derive from our visioning together as we work to achieve our potential. Ultimately, these new beginnings will lead to a fully indigenous clergy, economic sustainability, and a deeper appreciation of the unique gifts we bring to the wider church.
