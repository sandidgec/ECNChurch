                <div class="panel-body">Our relationship with the United States government has been difficult: We were forcibly removed from our land in 1863 and, on The Long Walk, were marched hundreds of miles away. Our possessions were taken, our farmlands destroyed, and our livestock killed. Later, our children were taken from us, placed in boarding schools, and punished for speaking our language and practicing our culture. We have internalized much of this sorrow, and today, we experience high rates of addiction and suicide. Given our geography, unemployment and under-employment are high.</div>

The Navajo Code Talkers of World War II are renowned for helping to win the war in the Pacific. Additionally, Navajo military enlistment is much higher than the national average.</div>

In 1978, The Episcopal Church founded the Area Mission on the 27,000 square miles in Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah, which are contiguous with the Navajo Nation. Until recently, our buildings were falling into disrepair and leadership and vision came from non-native clergy.</div>

                <div class="panel-body">Today, there is a new spirit and a new energy in our land! We have re-opened some churches and planted new ones. We have ordained two Navajo priests and three deacons. We have reached out to the many Navajo military veterans. We have repaired derelict properties for rental income and program use. We are exploring sustainable farming and aquaponics, expanding retreat opportunities and building hogans for educational ceremonial purposes. These efforts derive from our visioning together as we work to achieve our potential. Ultimately, these new beginnings will lead to a fully indigenous clergy, economic sustainability, and a deeper appreciation of the unique gifts we bring to the wider church.</div>
